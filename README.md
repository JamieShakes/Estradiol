A dumb little web framework to plug your database into for visualization

The plan for this project is effectively to be a template website which you can use to easily launch a website for yourself visualizing data.
For example, you may have a set of sports statistics; you would be able to make a site showing charts, graphs, rich filtering and searching, to explore your data in fun and funky ways.
